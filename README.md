# Searching-for-Strings - Permutations 
## Canadian Computing Contest Problem 3 

Problem Description

You’re given a string N, called the needle, and a string H, called the haystack, both of which contain only lowercase letters “a”..“z”.

Write a program to count the number of distinct permutations of N which appear as a substring of H at least once. Note that N can have anywhere between 1 and |N |! distinct permutations in total – for example, the string “aab” has 3 distinct permutations (“aab”, “aba”, and “baa”).
